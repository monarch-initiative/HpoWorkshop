HPO Workshop
============

The site contains material to help you learn about the `Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <https://hpo.jax.org/app/>`_. It is intended to support
workshops but can be used for self study. The workshop has a number of topics that are shown in the menu. Each topic contains one or more exercises
and a link to a page with hints and answers.

This application is designed to transform our internal HPO Annotation files (the small files)
together with the Orphanet XML file into the ``phenotype.hpoa`` file. It performs extensive Q/C on
the annotation files. By default it updates TermIds in the Orphanet files that have been updated.
