Introduction
############

The `Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <https://hpo.jax.org/app/>`_   was launched in 2008 to provide a comprehensive logical standard to describe and computationally analyze phenotypic abnormalities found in human disease. T
he HPO is now a worldwide standard for phenotype exchange. As an ontology, HPO enables computational inference and sophisticated algorithms that 
support combined genomic and phenotypic analyses. Broad clinical, translational and research applications using the HPO include genomic 
interpretation for diagnostics, gene-disease discovery, mechanism discovery and cohort analytics, all of which assist in realizing precision 
medicine. 

We have published several articles that explain how the HPO is constructed. The 2008 paper explains how the HPO was created, and the subsequent papers describe a series of improvements
and innovations. For this workshop, we recommend skimming the 2021 manuscript.

Scope of the HPO
################

The HPO was initially developed for the analysis of Mendelian disease. Subsequently, the HPO has been used in a number of other contexts.  The following two papers discuss an extension
of the HPO to analyze common (complex) disease and an application of the HPO for leverage EHR-encoded laboratory data to search for biomarkers in asthma.

Translations and Plain-language HPO
###################################

We have developed a "translation" of the HPO into plain language that is intended for use by patients and their families.

Collaborating groups have created translations in European, Asian, African, and Australian aboroginal languages. Details are available on the `HPO Website <https://hpo.jax.org/app/help/translations>`_.


Community collaborations
########################

The HPO has benefited enormously from thousands of contributions from hundreds of clinicians and researchers across the world. This hasa led to a growth of the HPO from initially about 8000 terms to over 16,000 terms today.
We have received suggestions for new HPO terms on our GitHub tracker and have also conducted about 40 "hackathons" with domain experts from various fields on clinical medicine. Some of this
activity is summarized in the Nucleic Acids Research database articles listed above. In some cases, separate papers describing this activity were published.

Additional hackathons of this nature are planned over the next five years. Interested groups are invited to contact us for more information.
